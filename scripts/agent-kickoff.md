Before doing anything else:

1. Read ALL of AGENTS.md in this repository to understand the coordination protocol
2. Register with MCP Agent Mail using this repo's absolute path as project_key
3. Introduce yourself to the other agents via send_message

Then check your inbox (fetch_inbox) and coordinate on any remaining tasks with the team. Reserve files before editing them to avoid conflicts.

Current project focus: Bio MCP Chat - a Next.js AI chatbot with MCP integration for biological research applications.

Key areas that may need work:
- MCP server integrations (lib/mcp-client.ts)
- Code Mode sandbox improvements (lib/code-mode/)
- Slash command system (lib/slash/)
- UI components (components/)
- Testing coverage (tests/)

Coordinate with other agents. Don't duplicate work. Check file reservations before editing. Communicate progress via Agent Mail.
